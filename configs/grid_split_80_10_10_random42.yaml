# Random speaker split for GRID-style layout under `data/s*_processed/`.
# Generated with seed=42 from 33 speakers found in this repo:
# - train: 27 speakers (~81.8%)
# - val:   3 speakers  (~9.1%)
# - test:  3 speakers  (~9.1%)
#
# Note: current preprocessing code uses ONLY `train_speakers` and `val_speakers`.
# `test_speakers` is included for convenience/future use.
